## Mathematical Formulas Verified

### 1. Monthly Payment Formula âœ…
```
M = P Ã— [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = Monthly Payment
P = Principal Loan Amount
r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
n = Number of Monthly Payments
```

**Verification**: Matches industry standard calculators exactly

### 2. Amortization Formula âœ…
```
For each month:
Interest = Beginning Balance Ã— Monthly Rate
Principal = Payment - Interest
Ending Balance = Beginning Balance - Principal
```

**Verification**: Manual calculation matches service implementation

### 3. Standard Payoff Time Formula âœ…
```
n = -log(1 - (r Ã— P) / M) / log(1 + r)

Where:
n = Number of months to payoff
r = Monthly interest rate
P = Current principal balance
M = Monthly payment
```

**Verification**: Produces exactly 360 months for standard 30-year mortgage

### 4. HELOC Interest Calculation âœ…
```
HELOC Interest = HELOC Balance Ã— (HELOC Rate / 12 / 100)
```

**Verification**: Accumulates correctly each month during paydown period

## Critical Bug Fixes Applied

### Bug #1: Interest Timing Error âœ… FIXED
**Location**: `helocVelocityService.ts:89`

**Before (INCORRECT)**:
```typescript
helocBalance += actualChunk;
mortgageBalance -= actualChunk;
const mortgageInterestThisMonth = mortgageBalance * monthlyMortgageRate; // WRONG!
```

**After (CORRECT)**:
```typescript
// Calculate interest on BEGINNING balance (before any payments)
const mortgageInterestThisMonth = mortgageBalance * monthlyMortgageRate;

// Apply regular mortgage payment first
const regularPrincipal = mortgagePayment - mortgageInterestThisMonth;
mortgageBalance -= regularPrincipal;

// Then apply chunk payment from HELOC
const effectiveChunk = Math.min(actualChunk, mortgageBalance);
helocBalance += effectiveChunk;
mortgageBalance -= effectiveChunk;
```

**Impact**: Was understating mortgage interest by calculating on post-payment balance

### Bug #2: Missing Regular Payment âœ… FIXED
**Before**: Chunk payment applied directly without regular monthly payment
**After**: Regular payment applied first, then chunk payment

**Impact**: Was creating phantom principal reduction

2. Run `node dist/scripts/comprehensiveInterestTests.js` for full test suite
3. Both scripts should show 100% pass rate

### ðŸ“Š Future Enhancements
1. Add property for test automation in CI/CD pipeline
2. Add visual regression tests for calculation results
3. Add performance benchmarks for large-scale calculations
4. Consider adding fuzzing tests with random inputs
